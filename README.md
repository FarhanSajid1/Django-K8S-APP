Django kubernetes application

Django Kubernetes application!

This is a CI/CD application using Python specifically the Django-Rest-Framework, this is a blog-style application inspired by 
Corey Schafer on YouTube. The blog application includes posts with CRUD operations, as well as a User service with
Authentication. We then dockerize the application and run the application on Kubernetes!
